# Sorting Algorithms for Integer Arrays

The implementation of 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

##Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order using two nested for loops.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

##Merge Sort

The Merge Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order using the divide et impera method.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

##Radix Sort

The Radix Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order using auxiliary functions to compare the digits of the same significance.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
